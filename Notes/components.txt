Components are the building blocks of React. UI is divided into logical reusable parts called components.
  There are two types of components available in React
  i. functional component
  ii. class component

  functional components are defined as functions and do not have their own state. For state, they need to import 'useState' hook. In olden times, these components also called stateless components
  syntax: 
    function Component-name(){
        return (
            //HTML code
        )
    }
 
  class components are defined as classes which uses 'render' method to return JSX code and these components have state by default.
    class Component-name extends Component{
        render(){
            return (
                //HTML code
            )
        }
    }

 Components render each time a state value changes. Like Human have different phases of life, components also goes to different phase of its life cycle.

 Basically, we can divide life cycle methods into 4 categories
   i. inital stage : In this stage constructor method will be called automatically
   ii. mounting stage : mounting is the starting (first render ) stage of a component
      a. getDerivedStateFromProps(): This method will be called right after constructor and it is used to take state values from the props
      b. render(): The render method is called after getDerivedStateFromProps. it returns JSX that makes the view of component.
      c. componentDidMount(): This method is called after the render and it is used for any initial setup
   iii. update stage : 
    a. getDerivedStateFromProps(): This method will be called right after any change and it is used to take state values from the props
    b. shouldCoponentUpdate(): This component ensures whether okay to update the component or not 
    c. render(): The render method is called after shouldCoponentUpdate. it returns JSX that makes the view of component.
    d. componentDidUpdate(): This method is called after the render and it is used for any every update
   iv. unmounting stage:
   a. componentDidUnmount(): This method is called at end of component life cycle
