Every Time a change happens in react app, it create virtual DOM to compare with previous virtual DOM and will update only the changed part to the actual DOM. This is called 'rendering'
Every re-render of app is called 'state'
  
  -- class components default state object
  -- functional components don't have default state so called as stateless components but react 16 introduces hooks.
  functional components can use a hook 'useState' to update and render a value

 i. useState:
     useState is the hook of fundamental way to manage state in react functional components
     useState returns an array of a state value and a function to update state and it accepts initial value
     const [value,setValue]= useState(initialValue)
