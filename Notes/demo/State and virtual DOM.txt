State:  In React state refers to the data that changes within a component. state is an object that stores the component's dynamic data. it's used to render the component

 A state will have initial state, update state method, modified state.

 state and props both are used to store the data in react components  but state stores
dynamic data that changes within a component and props passes the data from a parent component to child component

 we can mention/use state using a hook called
"useState" in functional components.
syntax:
   import {useState} from 'react'

   const [stateValue,stateUpdateMethod] = useState(initial value)

Virtual DOM:
    The Virtual DOM is a lighweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. It is a key feature in react that enables the efficient fast rendering of components.
  
How it works?
  i. when a component is rendered , react creates a virtual DOM representation of component tree
  ii. when the state of component changes, react updates the virtual DOM with the previous One. This process is called 'Diffing'
 iii. react generates a patch that describes the changes between two virtual DOM's
 iv. react applies that patch to the real DOM so that only changes will be updated , not the whole component.


Basic react features such as JSX, components,props,state will help us to create simple react applications
   --> React application uses a bundler called vite or create-react-app
   --> vite uses HMR(Hot Module Reloading and create-react-app uses local build
  --> vite uses its own web pack and create-react-app don't have default web pack
  --> vite and create-react-app uses babel as a transpiler
