  what is React js?
        React is a front end js library which is used to create single page applications and progressive web apps(eg:web whatsapp)
  --> React Js is created and maintained by "meta". it is initially started in 2010 as internal language and later got open sourced in 2013.

 why React?
   React is easy to learn and easy to customise using other libraries
  popular companies such as airbnb,netflix etc.., uses react
  React uses JSX structure for building components
  React is a open source and works with both JS and TS

React vs React Native:
     React is used for web applications or websites and React Native is used for mobile applications

React vs angular:
  i. React follows functional programming mostly after react 16 and angular follows OOP
 ii. React is a library and angular is a framework.
 iii. library is a pre written code used for specific purpose but framework provides complete developer enviroment
 iv. both uses components but react does one way data binding and angular uses two way data binding

  Installation:
  step 1: Download & Install VSCode
  step 2: Download & Install nodeJS
       To install or uninstall any library/package, we need a package manager. nodeJS contain npm(node package manager)
     after installation, goto cmd --> node -v
   also verify "npm -v"
  to Update older versions npm install nodejs@latest
